Facebook like Simulation in C# showcasing practical implementations of design patterns 


This project is a simulation of a social media platform inspired by Facebook, implemented in C#. Its main purpose is to apply and demonstrate various design patterns that have been learned. The project provides a practical environment for learning and understanding design patterns by creating a functional and interactive platform. It encompasses a wide range of design patterns, including but not limited to Singleton, Observer, Iterator,facade,Cache proxy and Strategy patterns, among others. Through this project, users can explore the implementation of these design patterns in a real-world scenario, gaining valuable insights into their usage and benefits. It serves as a valuable resource for developers and enthusiasts interested in learning and practicing design patterns in the context of software development.

To run the solution:

1. create the UI as a startup project.

2. add references to the Facebook.dll and FbGraphApiWrapper.dll files into the Engine through Browse (located in the FBApi folder).

3. Same as step 2, but this time for the UI namespace.

4. Change the build configuration from "Any CPU" to "x64" right next to START, and then click START.
